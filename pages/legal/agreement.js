          1. Our Responsibilities To You 1.1 Internet Access Kraus Online's
          Internet Service (referred to as the “Service”) is a service provided
          by Kraus Online that will provide you interactive access to the
          Internet as a registered customer or authorized user. The Service
          includes Internet access, e-mail, and other optional services
          described in your Services Guide provided through a single modem
          connection. To access the Service you must have a personal computer
          along with equipment such as a modem and a network interface card, and
          software. We will provide you with an Internet connection from a
          single computer connection in your home or business via either a cable
          modem (“Cable Modem Service”) or by dial-up access (“Dial-Up
          Service”). If you subscribe to KrausOnline Service, we will provide
          you with one cable modem that you may lease or purchase from us, the
          connection between the modem and your computer, and a network
          interface card. We will provide a single-user Internet Protocol (“IP”)
          address for each authorized modem and computer, and at least one (1)
          e-mail address or account. If you reside in an area serviced by a
          one-way cable system, it will be your responsibility to provide the
          modem used to connect to your standard telephone line to send signals
          back to us and to arrange with the cable TV company or installer to
          provide you, at your expense, with a cable outlet for a separate cable
          connection to your computer, should you wish to have one. If you
          subscribe to our Dial-Up Service, we will provide software, a
          single-user IP address for each authorized modem and computer, and at
          least one (1) e-mail address or account. It will also be your
          responsibility to provide a dial-up modem and telephone line. 1.2
          Other Services We may provide other services such as web page hosting,
          static IP addresses, additional bandwidth, additional e-mail
          addresses, remote file backup/storage, peer-to-peer networking and
          other services that are covered by separate agreements. We may
          describe some of the other services that we may provide in other
          written materials provided with your installation kit or that we may
          provide you at other times (such as, by way of example, a Services
          Guide). Some of those materials may be found at internet addresses
          included in some of those other materials. You will be bound by all of
          the terms and conditions of services included in other written
          materials, with your installation kit, and/or posted at internet
          addresses that have been included in the earlier materials. HOWEVER,
          if there is any difference between the terms of this Agreement and any
          of those other materials, terms or conditions, the terms of this
          Agreement control. Those other materials, terms and conditions are
          subject to change from time to time by Kraus Online, in Kraus Online’s
          sole discretion pursuant to Section 1.3 of this Agreement. 1.3 Changes
          To The Agreement We reserve the right to amend, alter, or modify this
          Agreement or any Service Guide at any time and in any manner. Any
          amendment, alteration, or modification (referred to collectively as
          “Changes”) may be either posted on Kraus Online’s website (www) or
          sent to your e-mail address. YOU ARE OBLIGATED TO CHECK KRAUS ONLINE’S
          WEBSITE AT LEAST EVERY THIRTY (30) DAYS FOR SUCH CHANGES. Any Change
          is effective on the thirty-first (31st) day after it is posted on
          Kraus Online’s website or sent to your e-mail address. Your continued
          use of the Service on or after that thirty-first (31st) day means that
          you agree to be legally bound by such Change(s). 2. General Subscriber

          as an individual at your current home or business, and is for your

          us of the address of this new location. Only one person at a time —
          you or one of the Authorized Users — may use your Account at any
          particular time. If you subscribe to Dial-Up Service, you may access
          your Account from locations other than your home or business. You are
          personally responsible for all use of the Service under your account
          even if your did not authorize someone to use it. You assume
          responsibility to ensure that all Authorized Users understand this

          responsible for the conduct of anyone using the Service under your
          Account. You agree that you are fully responsible for any consequences
          if such individual misuses the Service, violates this Agreement, or
          accesses material or information that you feel is obscene or otherwise
          objectionable. You agree to provide all Authorized Users a copy of
          this Agreement, and to inform them that their use of the Service is
          subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any changes
          or additions to the Agreement. 2.2 Age Restrictions The Service is

          age to use the Service. If you do, you acknowledge that you are
          responsible for providing adult supervision for any person who is less
          than 18 years of age who may use the Service, whether or not a member
          of your family or household. The Service may not be used to enable
          persons under 18 years of age to obtain material that is prohibited by
          law to be sent or displayed, including material deemed to be indecent
          or obscene. 2.3 Provide Accurate Information You agree to provide us
          with accurate, complete and current information for yourself and all
          authorized users, including legal name, age, address, telephone

          written permission from us. You agree not to use the Service for any
          type of business or commercial enterprise, including (but not limited
          to) the provision of Internet access to others or provision of a
          server site for FTP, Telnet, RLOGIN, electronic mail, web hosting or
          other comparable applications. You also agree not to use the Service
          to operate as an Internet Service Provider (“ISP”) or to operate any
          other business enterprise in competition with the Service. In
          addition, proxy servers are not allowed under this Account, and if you
          attempt to connect more than one computer to a given modem via proxy
          of any type, we reserve the right to terminate the Service. Without

          Service include, but are not limited to, FTP, HTTP, POP and SMTP, DNS,
          NNTP, and PROXY. We make other accounts available that would allow
          commercial or server access if you need it, but at a different fee
          schedule and at our sole discretion. If you believe you need some
          other type of account, for example, if you wish to add a hub and
          provide access to more than one computer in your household or your
          business, additional services can be purchased for this purpose (to be
          provided at our sole discretion). Please contact us for a description
          of those other services and their pricing. 2.5 Passwords and Password

          at risk if you let someone use it inappropriately. You are responsible
          for the use of the Account and the confidentiality of your
          password(s). We will make a reasonable effort to suspend access to the
          Service through a particular password, or change your access password,
          upon notification by you that the particular password has been stolen,
          lost or otherwise compromised. You must immediately notify us of any
          known or suspected unauthorized use of your Account and/or any known
          or suspected breach of security, including without limitation loss,

          e-mail or in any post or transmission to any newsgroup or mailing list
          or other similar groups or lists. 6.9 No Abuse Of Newsgroups You agree
          that you will not post a single item to more than three (3) newsgroups
          or mailing lists or other similar groups or lists.You agree that you
          will not post to any newsgroup or mailing list or other similar groups
          or lists, items which are off-topic (for example, off-topic according
          to the charter of the newsgroup or mailing list or other similar
          groups or lists or if the item provokes complaints from regular
          readers of the newsgroup or mailing list or other similar groups or
          lists for being off-topic).You agree that you will not post or
          transmit any private , third party e-mail to any newsgroup or mailing
          list or other similar groups or lists without the explicit approval of
          the sender. 6.10 No Violation Of Other Laws Or Online Service Rules
          You agree that you will comply with all laws and regulations that
          govern your conduct in connection with the use of the Service and the
          Internet. These include restrictions on exportation of encryption
          software.You agree that you will not violate the terms and conditions
          and operating rules of any other interactive service that you access
          via the Service. These include newsgroups and mailing lists, or other
          similar groups or lists and websites. 6.11 Excessive Use Of Bandwidth
          We consider usage over 1.5TB(as of 4/1/21) to be classified as
          excessive bandwidth usage. If we determine, in our sole discretion,
          that your account is using, or has consistently used, an excessive
          amount of bandwidth, we may terminate your account at any time and
          without notice, or require you to pay additional fees in accordance
          with our Pricing Schedule. Overage amounts will be calculated at the
          rate of $1 per 5GB or $20 per 100G. If you exceed the monthly data in
          your plan, typically you will see the charges for additional data on
          the next month's bill. 6.12 No “Viruses” You agree that you will not
          use, nor allow others to use, your account to intentionally transmit
          computer “viruses,” or other harmful software programs and that you
          will use your best efforts to prevent the unintentional transmission
          of such viruses or other harmful software programs. 7. Service and
          Performance 7.1 Service Availability We will make reasonable efforts
          to assure that the Service will be available to you 24 hours per day,
          7 days per week. It is possible, however, that there will be
          interruptions of service. You acknowledge and agree that the Service
          may be temporarily limited, interrupted or curtailed for many reasons,
          including without limitation, limitations of either your or our
          equipment software, forward error correction overhead (FEC), 10Base-T
          Ethernet connections to your PC; network traffic or other technical
          glitches or malfunctions; system capacity limitations imposed on or
          experienced by the underlying communications carriers; governmental
          action; acts of God or other reasons beyond our control; equipment or
          systems failures or modifications, upgrades, maintenance, repairs or
          similar activities required or appropriate for the delivery or
          improvement of the Service. With respect to Dial-Up Service, we will
          make reasonable efforts to assure that we have sufficient capacity and
          facilities to support our Dial-Up Service subscribers. It is possible,
          however, that there will be times during which these facilities will
          be fully utilized by other subscribers. You acknowledge and agree that
          Dial-Up Service may be temporarily unavailable. You also acknowledge
          and agree that Dial-Up Service may be unavailable for reasons beyond
          our control, such as problems with your local telephone network. 7.2
          Finite Bandwidth Of KrausOnline Service KrausOnline Service is
          provided over a shared network. The bandwidth used by the KrausOnline
          Service coexists with cable television service using the same
          facilities. You and all other users share a large, but still limited,
          amount of bandwidth. As a result, depending, among other things, upon
          the intensity of customer use of the KrausOnline Service and the time
          of day you use the KrausOnline Service, the bandwidth available to
          you, and the speed of the Service, will not always be at optimum
          levels. We do not guarantee any particular amount of bandwidth. We
          will, however, manage the KrausOnline Service to provide appropriate
          bandwidth for as many customers as is reasonably practical. 7.3
          Disruption of Cable Service If you subscribe to KrausOnline Service,
          it may affect the video programming portion of your television
          service. You waive any and all claims arising out of, or alleged to
          arise out of, the impact of the foregoing video programming. You also
          agree to promptly report any problems with your video programming
          services to the local video programming office by telephone. 8
          LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: NO WARRANTIES 8.1 No Liability For Content We
          supply access to the Internet through the Service, but we are not the
          publisher of any information provided by others through the Internet
          other than information on our own websites. We do not review, censor,
          or monitor any programs or content sent or accessed over the Internet
          or made available by any individual, user, information provider,
          on-line service or content provider. Such content or programs may
          include, without limitation programs or content of an infringing,
          abusive, profane or sexually offensive nature. All content from other
          parties accessed via the Service is accessed by you and those you have
          authorized, all at your own risk. We are not in any manner responsible
          for such content or programs. We assume no liability whatsoever for
          any claims, losses, action, damages, suits or proceedings arising out
          of or otherwise relating to such content accessed using the Service.
          8.2 No Liability For Viruses Files downloaded from the Internet and/or
          the World Wide Web, any Internet service, content or other on-line
          service provider, or other information provider, may contain
          corrupted, damaging or self-executable files that could corrupt,
          destroy or otherwise damage data, files, software and/or hardware on
          your home computer. Typically, these are called “viruses.”We make NO
          REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY that any software and/or files you may
          download from the Internet, the World Wide Web, any other Internet
          service provider, content provider, on-line service provider or other
          information provider is free from any virus or other damaging or
          destructive attribute. We make no representation or warranty that any
          software installed on the computer, including software installed by
          us, our agents, employees and contractors does not contain any virus
          or other damaging or destructive attribute. We have no responsibility,
          and assume no liability for, such acts or occurrences. 8.3 No
          Liability For Unauthorized Access Because the Service is a shared
          network, and because it provides access to the Internet and the World
          Wide Web, it is possible that others may access or monitor the data
          you send and/or receive to and/or from the Internet and/or the
          Service. Also, the Internet uses facilities that are generally used
          for public access to transmit voice and data communications. For these
          reasons, the Service may not be completely private or secure.
          Accordingly, we do not warrant that any data or files you send over
          the Service and/or receive through the Service will be free from
          unauthorized access by others, or that other users (often called
          “hackers”) would be unable to gain access to your computer. You agree
          that we are not liable for any claim, loss, damage or costs that may
          result from your lack of privacy or breach of security on or through
          the Internet and/or the World Wide Web or otherwise through your use
          of the Service. If you choose to run applications from your computer
          that permits others to gain access to it, you must take appropriate
          security measures. Failure to do so may cause immediate termination of
          the Service by us. We are not responsible for and assume no liability
          for any damages resulting from others accessing your computer. 8.4
          Peer-To-Peer Networking Some software includes capabilities that
          permit other users across a network such as the Service and the
          Internet to gain access to your computer and to the software, files
          and data stored on the computer. For example, operating systems such
          as Windows and Apple Macintosh include file sharing and print sharing
          capabilities which, when enabled, may permit other users to gain
          access to your computer even if you are not using the Service. The
          Service is typically configured NOT to permit peer-to-peer networking
          or file-sharing. If you request that we enable that feature, we will
          ask you to sign a separate release and liability waiver through which
          you would acknowledge the extreme security risks to your computer and
          the privacy of your data and files associated with peer-to-peer
          networking. Moreover, if you choose to run an application that might
          permit others to gain access to your computer, you do so at your own
          risk and should take appropriate security measures. You may want to
          consider installing third-party authentication encryption software to
          protect your hardware, data and/or e-mail files. We shall have no
          liability for any claims, losses, actions, damages, suits or
          proceedings arising out of or otherwise relating to use of
          peer-to-peer networking, file-sharing, and/or authentication
          encryption software by you. 8.5 NO WARRANTY/LIMITATION OF
          LIABILITY/YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT USE OF THE
          SERVICE, SOFTWARE AND EQUIPMENT SUPPLIED BY US OR OUR AGENTS,
          EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTORS (HEREINAFTER COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE
          “COMPANY”) IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SERVICE, EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE

          COMPANY’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO
          USE OF THE SERVICE, E-MAIL SERVICES AND SOFTWARE AND EQUIPMENT, AND/OR

          THIS AGREEMENT OR THE REPLACEMENT OF ANY DISKETTE OR KRAUS ONLINE
          SUPPLIED EQUIPMENT FOUND TO BE DEFECTIVE. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE KRAUS
          ONLINE’S LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT
          EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO ACCESS AND USE THE SERVICE WITHIN THE
          THREE (3) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE CLAIM. IN NO EVENT
          SHALL KRAUS ONLINE BE LIABLE, EVEN UPON THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL
          PURPOSE OF ANY EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT
          PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES OR DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY MANNER OUT
          OF THE INSTALLATION, MAINTENANCE, FAILURE, REMOVAL OR USE OF THE
          SERVICE, E-MAIL SERVICES OR KRAUS ONLINE SUPPLIED SOFTWARE OR
          EQUIPMENT. 8.6 NO WARRANTY NOR LIABILITY FOR INTERNET CONTENT OR
          TRANSACTIONS YOU ASSUME TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK FOR YOUR USE OF
          THE INTERNET GENERALLY. IT IS ALSO SOLELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO
          EVALUATE THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, USEFULNESS OR VALIDITY OF ALL
          OPINIONS, ADVICE, SERVICE, PROMOTIONS, ADVERTISEMENTS, AWARDS, PRIZES

          PROVIDED THROUGH THE INTERNET OR ON THE INTERNET GENERALLY, OR AS TO
          THE ACCURACY, QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
          PURPOSE, OR OTHERWISE OF ANY MATERIALS ACCESSED THROUGH THE INTERNET.
          WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE E-MAIL SERVICES AND OUR SOFTWARE AND
          EQUIPMENT, WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES,
          INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
          AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. WE DO NOT ENDORSE, WARRANT OR
          GUARANTEE ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE OFFERED THROUGH OUR SERVICE OR THE
          INTERNET AND WILL NOT BE IN ANY WAY RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ANY
          TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR
          SERVICES. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COSTS OR CHARGES YOU
          INCUR THROUGH YOUR PURCHASING OR OTHER ACTIVITIES THROUGH OR ON THE
          INTERNET. 8.7 No Liability For Use In A Hazardous Environment The
          Software is not fault-tolerant. It is not designed, manufactured or
          intended for use or resale as online control equipment in hazardous
          environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation
          of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communications systems,
          air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons systems,
          in which the failure of the Software could lead directly to death,
          personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. We and
          our licensors specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty of
          fitness for such use. 9. Indemnification If the use of your account
          causes us to be exposed to legal claims, you are responsible for the
          cost of defending against such claims. You agree to defend, indemnify
          and hold harmless us, our officers, directors, employees, affiliates
          and subsidiaries and telecommunications providers from and against any
          and all claims, proceedings, damages, injuries, liabilities, losses,
          costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising out of or
          relating to any acts by you (or others who use your Account) or
          materials or information transmitted by you (or others who use your
          Account) in connection with this Agreement, the Service or the
          Internet. This includes any illegal or improper use of the Account by
          those individuals whom you authorized to use your Account or who have
          accessed your Account due to your negligence or carelessness.If we
          choose, we may (but we will have no obligation to) monitor the defense
          of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and you
          will take such steps (including providing direction to your legal
          counsel) as we may request to assure us full access to all information
          about the defense of the matter. In addition, or in the alternative,
          if we choose we may (but we will have no obligation to) assume control
          of the defense of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by
          you, using your counsel, or through our own separate counsel (or
          both), all at your cost and expense (including all attorneys’ fees,
          whether your or our counsel) and without derogating your indemnity
          obligations. In any event, regardless of who controls the defense of
          any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, no settlement
          of any such matter may occur without our prior written consent, which
          we may give or withhold in our discretion. 10. Termination of Service
          10.1 Termination By Either Party Either we or you may terminate or
          cancel your account at any time. In the event that your account is
          terminated or cancelled, no refund, including any fees you have paid
          to us, will be granted; no online time or credits (for example, points
          in an online game) will be credited to you, nor can it be converted to
          cash or another form of reimbursement.If you or we terminate your
          account, we reserve the right to delete your e-mail addresses, and
          require you to delete any or all program or data files associated with
          the Account, and/or take any other actions we may deem appropriate to
          terminate fully all of your rights, access to, and/or use of the
          Service. We have no obligation to visit your home or office upon
          termination to reconfigure your computer, and we do not do so. 10.2
          Termination Methods You may terminate your Account by delivering
          notice to our billing department 815/478-4000 or by sending your

          60442. You still must pay for all charges, including late charges,
          accrued until your password and e-mail account has been deactivated,
          including full monthly charges for the month during which the
          termination occurs. We reserve the right to collect fees, surcharges
          or costs incurred before you cancel your account. In addition, you are
          responsible for any charges incurred to third-party vendors or content
          providers prior to your cancellation. 10.3 Sole Remedy is in Section

          related to, or arising out of: (1) any term of this Agreement or our
          enforcement or application of this Agreement; (2) any of our practices
          or policies; (3) the content available through the Service or the

          inputting data, or engaging in any form of communication
          (collectively, “Communications”) in or through the Internet, you are
          granting to us a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide non-exclusive
          license (the “License”) to use, perform, display, copy, modify, adapt
          or document such Communications. We may use the Communications and any
          derivative works thereof in conjunction with providing, promoting,
          distributing or otherwise exploiting the Service, and you shall have
          no recourse against us for any alleged or actual infringement of any
          proprietary rights to which you may claim ownership as a result of
          such actions. Except as provided in this Agreement, the License does
          not grant us any ownership rights in or to your Communications. We or
          our suppliers own all rights, title and interest in and to all
          components of the Service, but expressly excluding content owned by
          third parties that may be accessible through the Service and/or the
          Internet generally. Our ownership rights in the Service include, but
          are not limited to, the look and feel of the end-user interfaces
          associated with the Service, the name of the Service, and the
          collective works consisting of all public messages on the Service. You
          may not reproduce any sequence of messages from our Service without
          our permission. 12. Miscellaneous 12.1 Entire Agreement This
          Agreement, including the Services Guide and the Pricing Schedule
          mentioned in Sections 1.2 and 4.2, constitutes the entire agreement
